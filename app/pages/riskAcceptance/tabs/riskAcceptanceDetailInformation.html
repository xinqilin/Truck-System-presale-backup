            The remote host is missing Microsoft KB2264107 or an associated registry change, which provides a mechanism for mitigating binary planting or DLL preloading attacks.
            <br>
            <br> Insecurely implemented applications look in their current working directory when resolving DLL dependencies. If a malicious DLL with the same name as a required DLL is located in the application's current working directory, the malicious DLL will be loaded.
            <br>
            <br> A remote attacker could exploit this issue by tricking a user into accessing a vulnerable application via a network share or WebDAV folder where a malicious DLL resides, resulting in arbitrary code execution.

            Microsoft has released a set of patches for Windows XP, 2003, Vista, 2008, 7, and 2008 R2 :
            <br>
            <br> Please note this update provides a method of mitigating a class of vulnerabilities rather than fixing any specific vulnerabilities. Additionally, these patches must be used in conjunction with the 'CWDIllegalInDllSearch' registry setting to have any effect. These protections could be applied in a way that breaks functionality in existing applications. Refer to the Microsoft advisory for more information.
